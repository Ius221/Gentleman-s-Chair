# 🎩 Gentleman's Touch | SaaS Project

### 🤫 The Project is Secret. The Quality is Not.

**Gentleman's Touch** is a high-performance SaaS platform currently under active development. While the full business logic and market application are currently "Stealth Mode" (waiting for the final release), the technical foundation is being built in public.

This project is a deep dive into complex role-based access control (RBAC) and scalable system design.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application is built on a robust 3-layer architecture to ensure complete isolation of concerns and secure data handling:

1. **Admin Suite:** High-level oversight, system configuration, and global data management.
2. **Manager Portal:** Operational tools designed for the "Barber/Service Provider" level to manage workflows.
3. **Client Interface:** A seamless, user-centric frontend for the end-user experience.
